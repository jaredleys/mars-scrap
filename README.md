# Mars Scrap
Scraping news about Mars for the Mars news scraping site.

This project uses Splinter, PyMongo, Flask, and Pandas to create a site that exhibits some of the latest news about Mars.

News and images are scraped from three websites that contain information and data about the planet mars. A Python function scrapes the data and is pulled by the Flask app, which renders it into an HTML template.
